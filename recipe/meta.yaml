  summary: 'Transparent dictionary-based row-level compression for SQLite'
  description: |
    Extension for sqlite that provides transparent dictionary-based row-level
    compression for sqlite. This basically allows you to compress entries in a
    sqlite database almost as well as if you were compressing the whole DB
    file, but while retaining random access.
